# Course Website

\
A responsive Web Development course website where users can view basic course content such as syllabus, resources, etc. They can also choose to **login** or **register** as a **student** or **instructor** to access additional features. Instructors can access their account page to view feedback, edit student marks, and obtain visuals and analysis of the student mark data [Figure 1].  Students can submit remark requests, send feedback, and view their grade summary. Although Flask-SQLAlchemy has its own "Pythonic" way of handling databases (ORM), I prefer using raw SQL queries as it is much easier to read and maintain [Figure 2].
